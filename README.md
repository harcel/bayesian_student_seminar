# The how and why of statistically modeling student results

Seminar at the UvA DSC on Nov 25, 2022

This is a demo, in which bayesian inference is used to model student ability and course difficulty on observed student grades.

The file `utils.py` contains many utility functions to keep the notebook clean (but hopefully still self-explanatory).


To install a conda environment that can run the code:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

The notebook uses Rise.js to make it a slideshow, which makes some cells look a bit odd in notebook mode.
